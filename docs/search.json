One goal of this project is to provide an optimal way of selecting tobacco retailers for inspection. We propose an approach based on multi-level propensity score model (PSM) to predict the retail violation of sales to minors (RVSM).\r\nThis website also includes information and publications of different small area estimation projects completed related to youth tobacco consumption. Please refer to the “Articles” page to view some of the related articles.\r\nThe dashboard displayed by the following link provides easy access to locate retailer for inspection based on random sampling, and or based on the high risk retailers.\r\n\r\nClick here to view dashboard!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
